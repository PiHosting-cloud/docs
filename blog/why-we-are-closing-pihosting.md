# Why we are closing PiHosting
PiHosting is closing on the 16th of April 2023.
We simply couldn't afford running PiHosting for free and certainly not expanding it even further.
It also wasn't motivating how unthankful a lot of people were who simply took this free hosting for granted.

We'll continue providing support for our VPS customers and will probably also continue selling VPS services.

I'm pretty sure this is not the definite end of PiHosting, we'll probably get it back online when we want to and, above all, have the money to do so.

Goodbye.
