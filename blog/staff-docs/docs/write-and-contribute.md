# How to write and contribute your own docs!
(this page is only for PiHosing staff. If you see this anyway you might be tech-savy enough to become a staff member! More info on applying is in our Discord.)

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com). Create an account or log in to your account.
2. Visit the page of our [documentation on GitHub](https://github.com/PiHosting-cloud/docs)
3. Create a Fork of our repository.
4. Edit/Create new docs in your forked repository. Just copy existing folders and pages in the 'docs' directory and edit them.
5. When you're on your main page, you should see a button to create a pull request to the parent repo. Do that.
6. Wait for us to review and maybe merge it into our docs!
